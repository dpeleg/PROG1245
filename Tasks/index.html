				[Verse 1]<br>
				I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star<br>
				To pray on, or wish on, or something like that<br>
				I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy<br>
				Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had<br>
				But then the dove of hope began its downward slope<br>
				And I believed for a moment that my chances<br>
				Were approaching to be grabbed<br>
				But as it came down near, so did a weary tear<br>
				I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag
			</p>
			<p id="para2">
				[Chorus]<br>
				Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh, it kills<br>
				'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up<br>
				I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold<br>
				Hunger hurts, but starving works<br>
				When it costs too much to love
